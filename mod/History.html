				Bookstores (called bookshops in the United Kingdom, Australia and most of the Commonwealth apart from Canada) may be either part of a chain, or local independent bookstores. Stores can range in size offering from several hundred to several hundred thousand titles. They may be brick and mortar stores or internet only stores or a combination of both. Sizes for the larger bookstores exceed half a million titles. Bookstores often sell other printed matter besides books, such as newspapers, magazines and maps; additional product lines may vary enormously, particularly among independent bookstores.

				Another common type of bookstore is the used bookstore or second-hand bookshop which buys and sells used and out-of-print books in a variety of conditions. A range of titles are available in used bookstores, including in print and out of print books. Book collectors tend to frequent used book stores. Large online bookstores offer used books for sale, too. Individuals wishing to sell their used books using online bookstores agree to terms outlined by the bookstore(s): for example, paying the online bookstore(s) a predetermined commission once the books have sold.

					<h3> Modern Bookseling </h3>
				<p>
				The modern system of bookselling dates from soon after the introduction of printing. Through the new mechanized process for printing, books became more affordable.[11] By the nineteenth century, the model of bookselling as we know it began to emerge. A professional group of booksellers in Leipzig decided to create their own association in 1824, and Borsenverin des Deustchen Buchhandels became the first group to publish outside of the printer's guilds leading to more people joining the profession without needing to be attached to a guild.
